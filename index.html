    <p class="info">Vint Cerf is a co-inventor of the internet. He worked on a team with Robert E. Kahn for many years before they actually achieved something.
    On a certain, very successful night, the became famous for inventing the internet. Being deaf, it was a challenge for Vint Cerf but he pulled it off.
    Today, Cerf is worth more than $40 million as he is the co-president of Google.</p></td>

    <p class="info">Vinton Grey Cerf was born June 23 1943 in connecticut. As a young boy, he despised school but loved computers. He was fascinated by them.
    He did really well in math and science but not that well in the other subjects. He had a special brain that fascinated everyone.
    In 1965, he got a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Stratford University.
    He then went on to win some more awards including the doctorate in computer science in 1970 and again in 1972. In 1973, Robert E. Kahn and Cerf met each other
    and teamed up to work on something extraordinary. Together, Kahn and Cerf both approached a professor at Stanford to help them with the process of creating such a
    complex algorithm. In 1974, they published what they called ARPA Internet. In 1976, they released TCP/IP. That means Transition Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
    That is a program to separate packet error checking and similar issues related to the same destinations and domains.</p></td>

    <p class="info">Like I said, Cerf created a system called ARPA. He also created a system called TCP/IP. His research of technology and computer studies revolutionized
    technology the way we understand it today. He and his work are both so famous to the world of technology that we consider him as one of the inventors of
    the internet.</p>
    <p class="info">He once said <q><b>I'd like to know what the Internet is going to look like in 2050. Thinking about it makes me wish I were eight years old.</b></q> Using
    that quote and believing in Vint Cerf, others have made countless codes and rules to make using the internet easier have been made.</p>
